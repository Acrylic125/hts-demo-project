# How to React
How to react is a part of the How to Series Programme that gives students the opportunity to teach a topic to fellow students.

This repository is used as part of the How to React programme to demonstrate fundamental React concepts like components, and hooks.

## Cocktail DB
This project is a modified version of this tutorial,https://youtu.be/ly3m6mv5qvg which was modified to suit the content of the programme.

Cocktail DB is a database that lets users browse for cocktails. 

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
1. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
1. Run `npm start` to run the project.

## Challenges
This project is incomplete! Use this project to test your knowledge by trying out the following challenges:

### Filtering and Sorting
Currently, cocktails can only be searched by names. We can extend this search to include description filters, ingredient filters, and sorting by alphabetical order.

### About page
Starting off simple, try making a simple page. You can change out 'App.js' to use an About page that will describe what Cocktail DB is about.

### Single cocktail page
A page that shows a specific cocktail, based on the url. So, if a user clicks on a cocktail in the browsing page, they should be redirected to a page specific for that cocktail that will have instructions on how to make and more information on the cocktail.

You can look into routing (e.g. React Router).

### Connecting to an API
Currently, this project uses hardcoded data. Create your own backend, and learn how to connect to it on the frontend (This repository).

You can look into creating a backend service (e.g. NodeJS + Express), and a library to handle APIs on the frontend (e.g. React Query).

### Switch out to another styling library or framework
CSS modules are awesome! However, writing raw CSS can be tedious and it can be easy to make your UIs look inconsistent.

You can look into Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, and styled components as examples.
